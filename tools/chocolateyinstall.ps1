# IMPORTANT: Before releasing this package, copy/paste the next 2 lines into PowerShell to remove all comments from this file:
#   $f='c:\path\to\thisFile.ps1'
#   gc $f | ? {$_ -notmatch "^\s*#"} | % {$_ -replace '(^.*?)\s*?[^``]#.*','$1'} | Out-File $f+".~" -en utf8; mv -fo $f+".~" $f

# 1. See the _TODO.md that is generated top level and read through that
# 2. Follow the documentation below to learn how to create a package for the package type you are creating.
# 3. In Chocolatey scripts, ALWAYS use absolute paths - $toolsDir gets you to the package's tools directory.
$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'; # stop on all errors
$toolsDir   = "$(Split-Path -parent $MyInvocation.MyCommand.Definition)"
# Internal packages (organizations) or software that has redistribution rights (community repo)
# - Use `Install-ChocolateyInstallPackage` instead of `Install-ChocolateyPackage`
#   and put the binaries directly into the tools folder (we call it embedding)
#$fileLocation = Join-Path $toolsDir 'NAME_OF_EMBEDDED_INSTALLER_FILE'
# If embedding binaries increase total nupkg size to over 1GB, use share location or download from urls
#$fileLocation = '\\SHARE_LOCATION\to\INSTALLER_FILE'
# Community Repo: Use official urls for non-redist binaries or redist where total package size is over 200MB
# Internal/Organization: Download from internal location (internet sources are unreliable)
$url = 'https://github.com/shipyard-run/shipyard/releases/download/v__version__/shipyard-windows-amd64.zip' # download url, HTTPS preferred
